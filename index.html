            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                <h4>Starbucks (2014 - 2024)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Starbucks was more than just the beginning of my professional journey; it became a cornerstone during some of the most transformative years of my life. 
                        I learned to navigate the ups and downs of life while building lasting relationships, refining my communication skills, and discovering the power of empathy and compassion. 
                        My time at Starbucks saw me through major milestones — graduating college, getting married, and weathering the loss of close loved ones. 
                        It was a constant, providing a sense of community and purpose during those challenging times.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Being part of the Starbucks family meant more than just making coffee; it was about connecting with people, mentoring new team members, leading meetings, and being a dependable presence for my colleagues. 
                        It taught me the value of listening, understanding, and supporting others, whether they were customers or teammates. 
                        Those years were not just about the work I did but the person I became—resilient, compassionate, and committed to making a positive impact on those around me.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The skills and values I cultivated at Starbucks have seamlessly transitioned into my passion for cybersecurity, blockchain, and decentralized technologies. 
                        Just as I thrived on building trust and fostering strong relationships with my team and customers, I now focus on securing digital interactions and safeguarding information in the complex world of technology. 
                        My experience with clear communication, active listening, and empathetic problem-solving directly translates to understanding the intricate needs of users and organizations in the tech space. 
                        The commitment to integrity and transparency I learned during those formative years fuels my dedication to the principles of decentralization and blockchain, where trust and security are paramount. 
                        As I move forward in my career, I aim to leverage these foundational traits to contribute to creating secure, transparent, and resilient systems that protect and empower communities on a global scale.
